<h1 align="center">Tips and Tricks</h1>
</p>

Here are a few tweaks that I make to the app to make it more functional. 
If you have any tips you'd like to share, feel free to add them in the [Discussions](https://github.com/frakman1/ContaCam/discussions) page and I will add it to this list.

To increase the Web UI session timeout and avoid logging in all the time, change a couple of PHP parameters as described [here](https://www.contaware.com/manual-faqs/21-05-contacam-networking/119-increase-web-interface-session-timeout.html)

---

 To get a direct, no-login URL to your Web UI, use a URL in this form (remember to [URL-encode](https://www.urlencoder.org/) any special characters in your password):

```bash
http://CONTACAM-PC1:PORT/?username=xxx&password=xxx
```

Similarly for an individual camera's feed: 

```bash
http://CONTACAM-PC1:PORT/CAMERA_NAME/push.php?username=xxx&password=xxx
```

---

  To troubleshoot any issues, look at the ContaCam log file (found under Settings -> View Log File)
```bash
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Contaware\ContaCam\log.txt
```
 
Also check the micro apache (`mapache.exe`) web server's log files for issues with starting the webserver. Those are stored in the same folder:
```bash
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Contaware\ContaCam\httpd_log.txt
```

To get bigger live snapshot thumbnails in the Web UI, you can change the size in the Camera Advanced Settings page:

To get more animated gifs in the recorded history page of a Camera, you can change the grid size by editing the `summarysnapshot.php` file in `C:\Program Files (x86)\ContaCam\microapache\htdocs`

Around line 60: (change to 42 instead of the default 12)
```php
// Max files per page, pages count and page offset
$max_per_page = 42
```
Around line 451: (change to 6 instead of the default 4)
```php
$max_container_width = 6 * $min_grid_width; // 12 responsive thumbs: 4 x 3, 3 x 4, 2 x 6 and 1 x 12
```
